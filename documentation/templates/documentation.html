<h2>Terminology</h2>

<h3>How methods work together</h3>
A method is just a sub-system, so a metasystem can have several sub-systems. 
These sub-systems or methods can work together in different ways:

<h4>Entries</h4>
<ul>

parallel - multiple methods can be active simultaneously
- priority order needs to be defined
<li>Prioritised: Which methods are entered depends on the order of priority, 
so first trades from the highest priority method are taken, then (if positions
are still available) the second highest priority, and so on.</li>
<li>Long - Short: is a version of this</li>

serial - only single method is operational at any time
- conditions need to be defined
<li>by (market) conditions: a matrix of 2x2 (or 3x3) can be made using 2 sets
of conditions, these conditions depend which method is active. Only 1 method 
can be active at any one time.
<li>freely programmable conditions?? just becomes a generic entry? NO because
this works on pool level, not stock - but then they can happen in parallel...
</ul>

Allow multiple positions of same stock?
PS	yes (limit = 0) limit per method??
PS?	only in different methods (limit = 0)
PS	no (limit = 1)

Force exit?:
PS	a new entry forces the same stock to exit from a different method 
			and if it is in the same direction, it will just continue - but 
			with different exits
PS	a new entry forces the same stock to exit from a different method if L-S is
			opposite
PS	a new entry forces the same stock to exit from a different method if S-L is
			opposite
S	a new method forces any and all positions from other methods to exit
			only for market cond.
PS	exits are never forced

<tr><td>Metasystem</td><td>
A metasystem is a framework of one or more methods that each have one or more 
entry and exit rules. 
The metasystem definition itself, its methods and their entry and exit rules
have may have one or more parameters that define how they operate, these 
parameters can be fixed or variable. 
When a metasystem is run, random values will be generated for each of the 
variable parameters, so in theory at least one parameter must be variable, but
in order to generate a varied number of systems more than 5 parameters should
be variable.
A metasystem has a markettype selector that may use a combination of indicators
on the pool or pool index (or its own equity curve??) to select which market
method is used.
Running a metasystem results in the generation of systems with their 
performance statistics (trades, equity).</td></tr>
<tr><td>System</td><td>
A system is a set of one or more methods that each have one or more entry and 
exit rules. All parameters of the system definition itself, its methods and 
their entry and exit rules are fixed.
In practice, a system is based on a metasystem, with fixed values for the 
metasystem's variable parameters.
A system can be generated manually, by selecting a metasystem and setting its
parameters, but (random) systems can be generated automatically by running the
metasystem.
In contrast to metasystems, systems can be run real-time to generate signals 
for the next trading day, after the close of each trading day.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Market</td><td>
A market(method) is a collection of entry and exit rules, at least one of each. If a
system has multiple methods, it must have a markettype defined. This
markettype defines what market this marketmethod operates in.
Each method may be be long or short.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Entry or Exit Rule</td><td>
A rule is a definition for generating an entry or exit signal. E.g. a fixed 
stop loss at a percentage under the entry price is a rule. Each method may have
 multiple entry and exit rules, but each rule may only be used once in each 
 method.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Signal</td><td>
A signal is a potential entry or exit for the next trading day. Unconditional 
signals will definitely be executed (e.g. 'at open'), conditional trades are 
signals that may get executed, depending on price development the next day 
(e.g. a stop loss at 5% under the entry price)
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pool</td><td>
Every system operates on a pool of stocks. Each pool has an associated index
that may be used to select a method. Pools have a date range and any 
(meta)system that uses the pool must have a date range that is inside that of
the pool it uses.
The stocks within the pool can also have a date range. By default their date
range is the date range of the pool, but it is possible to limit a stock to
a smaller date range than the pool it is in.
Additionally each stock also has a start and endddate in its definition, these
are only meant to be used to define the actual life span of the stock.
